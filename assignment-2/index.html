				<h1>Is there a correlation between functioning NYC public restrooms and poverty rates? <h1/h1>
				<h2>By Mariah Towles</h2>
			</div>

 		<p> NYC Public bathrooms always seem to be few and far between when you really need them. I was curious if these buildings just don’t have private bathrooms or if it's usually due to maintenance issues. I used June 2024 data from NYC Open Data portal to see where the bathrooms were located. I took note of which were ‘operational’ and which were ‘not operational.” I included bathrooms that were closed for maintenance in the “not operational” category. I wanted to see if there was a correlation between closed bathrooms and poverty levels in the same neighborhoods. <br> <br>I analyzed all of the restrooms with a ‘not operational’ status - paying close attention to their location. I also made another map of the poverty levels so that it would be much easier to compare. There seems to be some correlation between the two in many cases. Many of the bathrooms that did not operate were in impoverished neighborhoods but not all operating bathrooms were in financially stable neighborhoods. However, the best way to better understand and compare the data would be using a bar chart. The bar chart would have two bars per neighborhood - one for its poverty rate percentage and one for its number of public bathrooms that are not operating.</p>
